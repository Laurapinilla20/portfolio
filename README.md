# Portfolio README

## Introduction
Welcome to my portfolio! This document provides insight into my design process, the challenges I faced during development, and what I learned through creating this web portfolio.

## Process
Creating my portfolio was an interesting challenge as I found it easier to design for others than for myself. I can be very demanding at times, and I challenged myself internally throughout the process. This was an opportunity for self-leadership, decision-making, and discerning what best represents my skills and passion as a designer. 

I carefully selected each project, taking time to choose based on the type of work and clients I aim to attract. While not every project I've worked on is included, my portfolio showcases what I enjoy doing and what I excel at, ensuring it aligns with my career aspirations.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Self-Expectations**: Being my own client meant facing my high standards. I addressed this by setting clear objectives and timelines, allowing myself room for experimentation and growth.
- **Decision-Making**: Choosing which projects to include was challenging. I overcame this by prioritizing work that reflects my skills and interests, ensuring a cohesive and impactful portfolio.
- **Technical Issues**: Implementing animations and responsive design posed technical challenges. I utilized online resources, consulted documentation, and sought assistance from peers to overcome these hurdles.

## Lessons Learned
- **Self-Reflection**: Designing for oneself requires introspection and self-awareness. I learned to articulate my strengths, preferences, and professional goals through this process.
- **Flexibility**: Adaptability is key in design. I embraced iterative design, feedback, and refinement to continuously improve my portfolio.
- **Resourcefulness**: Leveraging available tools, frameworks, and resources enhances productivity and creativity. I explored various libraries, plugins, and design assets to enhance my portfolio's visual appeal and functionality.
